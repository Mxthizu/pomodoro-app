# Pomodoro Timer

This is a simple Pomodoro Timer application built with React.js. It allows you to customize the number of sessions and the length of the break between them, and it displays a progress bar and the time remaining in the current session or break.

## Getting Started

To get started, you can clone this repository to your local machine and install the dependencies using npm:

''
git clone https://github.com/your-username/pomodoro-timer.git
cd pomodoro-timer
npm install
''

You can then start the development server using:

''
npm start
''

## Usage

To use the Pomodoro Timer, simply enter the number of sessions you want to complete and click the Start button. The timer will start counting down the session time, and when it's done, it will automatically switch to the break time.

You can pause the timer at any time by clicking the Pause button, and you can reset the timer by clicking the Reset button.
